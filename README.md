## Game Description
- In this game you have to guess a number on the die 🎲 while it gets rolled. 
- If your guess is right then your score will be updated by one. 
- There is a 10 second wait/countdown between rolls.
- A 10 second opportunity to guess the roll.
- When you click your guess, the roll immediately happens and the result is reported.
- If the 10 seconds on the roll expires, it simply resets and there is no impact to your score.
