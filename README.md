# ROLL-THE-DICE
My first game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

<hr>

In this game you have to guess a number on the die 🎲 while it gets rolled. If your guess is right then your score will be updated by one. 

* There is a 10 second wait/countdown between rolls
* A 10 second opportunity to guess the roll 
* When you click your guess, the roll immediately happens and the result is reported 
* If the 10 seconds on the roll expires, it simply resets and there is no impact to your score.
